# Animated minecraft logo

Download [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/animated-loading-screen)! 

This minecraft plugin animates the minecraft logo, using the animation from Minecraft Dungeons.

Original idea is from [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/animated-splash-screen) but I rewrote it entirely to work with fabric and 1.21.1

Thanks to @schemil053 for adding the sound!

Check github branches for all the versions of the mod
